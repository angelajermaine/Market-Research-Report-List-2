<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CRT Defibrillator (CRT-D) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Internal Defibrillator</li><li>External Defibrillator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CRT-D, or Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Defibrillator, is a type of device used to treat heart failure by combining a defibrillator with a pacemaker to help control the heart's rhythm. Internal Defibrillators are surgically implanted devices that continuously monitor the heart's rhythm and deliver electrical pulses when needed. External Defibrillators, on the other hand, are portable devices used in emergency situations to deliver a controlled electric shock to restore the heart's normal rhythm. Both types play crucial roles in managing heart conditions and saving lives.</p></p>
