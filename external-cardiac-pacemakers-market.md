<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The External Cardiac Pacemakers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Chamber Pacemakers</li><li>Dual Chamber Pacemakers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>External Cardiac Pacemakers are medical devices used to regulate an individual's heartbeat. The market for these devices is divided into two main types: Single Chamber Pacemakers and Dual Chamber Pacemakers. Single Chamber Pacemakers utilize one lead wire to regulate heart rhythms, while Dual Chamber Pacemakers use two lead wires for more precise coordination of the heart's chambers. Both types of pacemakers help individuals with irregular heartbeats maintain a steady and healthy heart rhythm.</p></p>
