<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Generators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-grid</li><li>Off-grid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solar generators can be classified into two main market types: on-grid and off-grid. On-grid solar generators are connected to the utility grid and can contribute excess energy back to the grid, offsetting energy costs. Off-grid solar generators operate independently of the grid and are often used in remote locations without access to traditional power sources. Both types provide clean and renewable energy solutions, with on-grid systems offering the added benefit of potentially reducing electricity bills through net metering.</p></p>
