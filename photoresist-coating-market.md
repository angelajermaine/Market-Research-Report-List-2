<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photoresist Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Photoresist Coating</li><li>Negative Photoresist Coating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Positive photoresist coating is a type of photoresist that becomes more soluble when exposed to light, making it easier to remove during the development process. This type of coating is commonly used in applications where the desired pattern is left on the substrate after development. Negative photoresist coating, on the other hand, becomes less soluble when exposed to light, making it ideal for applications where the desired pattern is removed during development. Both types of photoresist coatings play important roles in various industries such as electronics, semiconductors, and microfabrication.</p></p>
