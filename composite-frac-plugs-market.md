<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Composite Frac Plugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Small Caliber</li><li>Large Caliber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Composite frac plugs are used in the oil and gas industry during hydraulic fracturing operations to isolate sections of the wellbore. They come in two main market types based on their size - small caliber and large caliber. Small caliber frac plugs are typically used in horizontal wells with smaller diameters, while large caliber frac plugs are used in vertical wells with larger diameters. Both types of frac plugs play a crucial role in ensuring the success of hydraulic fracturing operations by preventing fluid from flowing back into the wellbore.</p></p>
