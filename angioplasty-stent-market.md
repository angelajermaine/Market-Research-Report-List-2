<p><h1>Angioplasty Stent Market Provides a Comprehensive Analysis Including a Macro Overview of the Market as well as Micro Details such as Market Size and Competitive Landscape</h1></p><p><strong>Angioplasty Stent Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Angioplasty Stent is a medical device used to treat blockages in arteries that supply blood to the heart. The stent is inserted into the artery during an angioplasty procedure to keep it open and improve blood flow.</p><p>The Angioplasty Stent Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.6% during the forecast period. The market growth can be attributed to the rising prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, technological advancements in stent design and material, and increasing adoption of minimally invasive procedures.</p><p>One of the latest trends in the Angioplasty Stent Market is the development of bioresorbable stents, which are designed to dissolve over time, leaving behind a healed artery. These stents eliminate the long-term risks associated with traditional metal stents, such as late stent thrombosis and restenosis.</p><p>Another trend in the market is the increasing use of drug-eluting stents, which release medication to prevent the buildup of scar tissue in the artery. These stents have been shown to reduce the risk of re-narrowing of the artery and improve long-term outcomes for patients undergoing angioplasty procedures.</p><p>Overall, the Angioplasty Stent Market is expected to continue growing as more patients opt for minimally invasive treatments for coronary artery disease. The advent of new technologies and materials will further drive innovation in the market.</p></p>
