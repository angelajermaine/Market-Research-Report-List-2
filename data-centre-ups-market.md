<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Data Centre UPS Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Battery-Operated</li><li>Flywheel</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Data Centre UPS markets have two main types, battery-operated and flywheel. Battery-operated UPS systems are the most common choice due to their ability to provide backup power during outages. These systems use batteries to store and release energy as needed. On the other hand, flywheel UPS systems use a spinning flywheel to generate back-up power. They offer fast response times and a longer lifespan compared to batteries. Both types play a crucial role in ensuring uninterrupted power supply in data centres.</p></p>
