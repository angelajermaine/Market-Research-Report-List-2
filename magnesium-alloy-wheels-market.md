<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Magnesium Alloy Wheels Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cast</li><li>Forged</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Magnesium alloy wheels are commonly classified into two types: cast and forged. Cast wheels are made by pouring molten magnesium alloy into a mold and allowing it to solidify, resulting in a wheel with a lower production cost. On the other hand, forged wheels are created by applying high pressure to a solid piece of magnesium alloy, resulting in a stronger and more durable wheel, but with a higher production cost. Both types have their own advantages and are used in different applications based on their characteristics.</p></p>
