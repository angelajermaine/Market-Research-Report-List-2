<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Froth Flotation Frothers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Surface Active Agent</li><li>Nonsurfactant</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Froth flotation frothers are chemicals used in mineral processing to help create a stable froth on the surface of the flotation cell, which improves the separation of valuable minerals from waste material. They can be classified into two main types: surface active agents and nonsurfactants. Surface active agents are chemicals that reduce the surface tension of the liquid and promote bubble formation, while nonsurfactants are chemicals that do not have surface-active properties but still aid in froth formation.</p></p>
