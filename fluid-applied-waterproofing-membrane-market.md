<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fluid-applied Waterproofing Membrane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cold Fluid-applied Waterproofing Membrane</li><li>Hot Fluid-applied Waterproofing Membrane</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fluid-applied waterproofing membranes are divided into two main types: cold and hot. Cold fluid-applied membranes are applied at room temperature and do not require heat for installation. They are typically solvent-based and offer quick drying times. On the other hand, hot fluid-applied membranes need to be heated before application. They are usually rubberized asphalt-based and provide a more durable and flexible waterproofing solution. Both types offer protection against water infiltration and are used in various construction applications.</p></p>
