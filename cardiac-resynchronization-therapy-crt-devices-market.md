<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CRT-Pacemakers</li><li>CRT-Defibrillators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) Devices market consists of two main types: CRT-Pacemakers and CRT-Defibrillators. CRT-Pacemakers are used to treat patients with heart failure by sending electrical signals to coordinate the contractions of the heart chambers, improving its overall function. On the other hand, CRT-Defibrillators are similar to pacemakers but also have the ability to deliver an electrical shock to reset the heart's rhythm in case of a life-threatening arrhythmia. Both devices aim to improve heart function and overall quality of life for patients with heart failure.</p></p>
