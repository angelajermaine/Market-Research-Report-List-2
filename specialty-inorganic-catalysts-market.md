<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Specialty Inorganic Catalysts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heterogeneous</li><li>Homogenous</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Specialty inorganic catalysts are categorized into two types: heterogeneous and homogeneous. Heterogeneous catalysts are solid catalysts that are in a different phase from the reactants, typically used in industrial processes. Homogeneous catalysts, on the other hand, are in the same phase as the reactants, often in liquid form. Heterogeneous catalysts are preferred for their ease of separation from the reaction mixture, while homogeneous catalysts offer better selectivity in some reactions. Both types play important roles in catalyzing chemical reactions in various industries.</p></p>
