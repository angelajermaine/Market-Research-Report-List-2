<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surgical Imaging Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Image intensifier C-arms</li><li>Flat Panel Detector C-arms (FPD C-arms)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Surgical Imaging Systems are used in operating rooms to provide real-time imaging during procedures. There are two main types of systems: Image intensifier C-arms and Flat Panel Detector C-arms (FPD C-arms). Image intensifier C-arms use an intensifier to convert X-ray photons into visible light, while FPD C-arms use a flat panel detector for digital imaging. FPD C-arms offer higher image quality, better resolution, and lower radiation dose compared to Image intensifier C-arms, making them increasingly popular in the market.</p></p>
