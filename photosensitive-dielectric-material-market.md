<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photosensitive Dielectric Material Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Tone Type</li><li>Negative Tone Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Photosensitive dielectric materials are used in microelectronics for creating patterns on semiconductors. Positive tone type materials are exposed to UV light and become more soluble, allowing for the desired pattern to be etched. Negative tone type materials, on the other hand, become less soluble when exposed to UV light, leaving the exposed areas intact while the unexposed areas are etched away. Both types play a crucial role in the semiconductor industry for fabrication processes.</p></p>
