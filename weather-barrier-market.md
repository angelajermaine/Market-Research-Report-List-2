<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Weather Barrier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Impermeable</li><li>Semi-permeable</li><li>Permeable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Weather barriers are used in construction to protect buildings from moisture and weather damage. Impermeable barriers prevent any moisture from permeating through, providing the highest level of protection. Semi-permeable barriers allow some moisture to pass through while still providing resistance to weather elements. Permeable barriers allow for the highest level of moisture penetration, but still offer some protection against weather. Each type of barrier caters to different levels of moisture protection, allowing builders to choose the most suitable option for their specific needs.</p></p>
