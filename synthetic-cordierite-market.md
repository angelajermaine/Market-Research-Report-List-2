<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Synthetic Cordierite Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Porous Cordierite</li><li>Porous Cordierite</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Synthetic cordierite is available in two main types: non-porous cordierite and porous cordierite. Non-porous cordierite is a dense material that is resistant to thermal shock and has low thermal expansion, making it ideal for applications such as catalytic converters and diesel particulate filters. Porous cordierite, on the other hand, has a network of interconnected pores that allow for the passage of gases and liquids, making it suitable for applications such as ceramic filters and heat exchangers. Both types of cordierite offer excellent thermal stability and mechanical strength.</p></p>
